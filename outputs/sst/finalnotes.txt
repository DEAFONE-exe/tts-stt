Summary: Using the LGTM Stack with Grafana and Prometheus

1. Setting Up Tools:
   - Use Dino for applications, Hostinger for servers, and other relevant services for backend infrastructure.

2. LGTM Stack (Linux General Purpose Telemetry Machine):
   - Combine Grafana for real-time data analytics.
   - Utilize Prometheus for monitoring data streams and systems.

3. Video Analysis:
   - Capture logs with Loki in the browser to explore server performance and errors.
   - Analyze error logs from Loki via Tempor to identify root causes.

4. Application Integration:
   - Run applications using Dino on your Hostinger server for efficient integration with Grafana.

5. Notes on Integration:
   - Deploy to Hostinger, which ensures LGTM stack coverage.
   - Use Vanguard DDoS filtering and firewall settings on Hostinger to secure the environment.
