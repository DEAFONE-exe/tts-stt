The tutorial outlines the process of setting up the LGTM stack (Open Telemetry, Prometheus, Tempo, and Grafana) using Docker on a server hosted by Hostinger. Here's a detailed summary:

1. Introduction to the Stack:
   - The LGTM stack consists of Open Telemetry for collecting metrics, Prometheus as the backend service for time-series data storage, Tempo for tracing applications, and Grafana for visualization.
   - It's ideal for learning due to its simplicity but is not production-ready as the Docker image isn't designed for production use.

2. Deployment Process:
   - Installation begins by running Docker commands to install components: Open Telemetry (OT) as a background process on any language, Prometheus for metrics storage, and Tempas for traces.
   - Configuration steps involve connecting these services via their respective APIs within the Docker setup.

3. Connecting Data Sources:
   - Utilizes Dino, an open-source framework with TypeScript support, to build web applications automatically collecting telemetry data and logs on a server.
   - Example: A Dino app running at `http://localhost:8000` collects metrics like average request time and tracks application lifecycle events.

4. Extending Prometheus:
   - Explains how custom metrics can be added using meters or tracers within Dino, demonstrating flexibility in data collection.
   - Example includes tracking errors by filtering log data provided by Loki (logs source).

5. Grafana Integration:
   - Shows how Prometheus data is stored and displayed in Grafana, allowing real-time monitoring of metrics like request duration.

6. Deployment Considerations:
   - Security aspect mentions Hostinger's Vanguard features to protect against DDoS threats and other security risks.

7. Conclusion:
   - Highlights the tutorial as a great learning resource, inviting further content for more tutorials on similar topics.

This structured approach ensures clarity in explaining each component of the LGTM stack setup, its extensions, and deployment considerations.
