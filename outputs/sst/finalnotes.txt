The tutorial guides you through setting up an open-telemetry stack (including Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana, and Loki) on a Dino app using Hostinger's VPS. Here's the summary:

1. Components of LGTM Stack:
   - Open Telemetry: Collects server metrics like CPU usage and memory.
   - Prometheus: Aggregates and visualizes metrics via GraphQL queries.
   - Tempo: Tracks application traces for performance analysis.
   - Grafana: Displays data sources in a dashboard, including logs, metrics, and traces.

2. Setup Steps:
   - Install open-telemetry-collector on the server with Prometheus.
   - Configure each component to work together using Dino's automatic telemetry collection.

3. Benefits of Telemetry:
   - Errors are detected immediately via Grafana logs instead of user reports.
   - Metrics and traces provide insights into application performance.
   - Logs help trace error origins, aiding troubleshooting without digging through server logs.

4. Security: The hosting provider (Hostinger) offers Vanguard DDoS protection to safeguard against threats.

This setup is ideal for learning but not recommended for production due to potential limitations.
